# Program 8

## Program Description:  
- Write a program that prompts the reader for two integers and then prints:
  - The sum
  - The difference
  - The product
  - The average
  - The distance (absolute value of the difference)
  - The maximum (the larger of the two)
  - The minimum (the larger of the two)
- You are not allowed to use any max or min function.
  - Hint:  Use the abs function and compute:  |a - b| + a + b.
- All variables should be int except average
- Choose variable names which are meaningful for this problem, like Area, Width, etc.
